step 1: count the number of times each customer purchases each product
step 2: get the most frequent purchased product for each customer
step 3: join products table to get the name of product

WITH temp as (SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    count(*) as cnt 
FROM Orders
GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    p.product_id,
    product_name
FROM
(SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id 
FROM temp
WHERE (customer_id, cnt) in
(SELECT 
    customer_id,
    max(cnt) as max_cnt
FROM temp
GROUP BY 1))a JOIN Products p on a.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY 1, 2
