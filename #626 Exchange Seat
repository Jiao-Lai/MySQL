Solution:
    Switch seat id instead of seat.
    If seat id is odd, then change seat id as id + 1.
    If seat id is even, then change seat id as id - 1.
    Note: If the max seat id is odd, then this student keeps his/her seat id.


SELECT
    CASE WHEN id%2 = 1 THEN if(id = (SELECT max(id) FROM seat), id, id + 1 )
         ELSE id - 1
    END AS id,
    student  
FROM seat
ORDER BY 1
