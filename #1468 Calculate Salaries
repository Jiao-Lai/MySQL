step 1: use window function to get max salary within each company
step 2: calculate after tax salary based on max salary

SELECT
    company_id,
    employee_id,
    employee_name,
    ROUND(CASE WHEN max_salary < 1000 THEN salary
         WHEN max_salary BETWEEN 1000 AND 10000 THEN 0.76*salary
         ELSE 0.51*salary 
    END, 0) AS salary
FROM
(SELECT
    *,
    max(salary) over(PARTITION BY company_id) AS max_salary
FROM Salaries) a 
ORDER BY 1, 2

Table Salaries:

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| company_id    | int     |
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| salary        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(company_id, employee_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the company id, the id, the name and the salary for an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

0% If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than 1000$.
24% If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range [1000, 10000] inclusive.
49% If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than 10000$.
Return the result table in any order. Round the salary to the nearest integer.
