Solution:
    The idea is to count the number of times each player_id appear in the table Championships.
    step 1: select column from column 2-5 one column at a time, and union them together
    step 2: count the number of times each player_id appears

SELECT
    player_id,
    player_name,
    count(*) as grand_slams_count
FROM Players p join 
(SELECT
    Wimbledon as id
FROM Championships
UNION ALL
SELECT
    Fr_open as id
FROM Championships
UNION ALL
SELECT
    US_open as id
FROM Championships
UNION ALL
SELECT
    Au_open as id
FROM Championships) a on p.player_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1, 2
