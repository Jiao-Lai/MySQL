step 1: get first login date for each user
step 2: for each first login date within 90 days, calculate number of users whose first login date is that day

SELECT
    fst AS login_date,
    count(user_id) AS user_count
FROM
(SELECT
    user_id,
    MIN(activity_date) AS fst
FROM Traffic
WHERE activity = 'login'
GROUP BY 1) a
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-06-30', fst) <= 90
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

Table: Traffic

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| activity      | enum    |
| activity_date | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity column is an ENUM type of ('login', 'logout', 'jobs', 'groups', 'homepage').
 

Write an SQL query that reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.
