step 1: use window function to calculate sum of salary between 2 preceding and current row, create row_number to get most recent record for each employee
step 2: drop most recent record

select
    Id,
    Month,
    Salary 
from
(select
    Id,
    Month,
    sum(Salary) over(partition by Id order by Month rows between 2 preceding and current row) as Salary,
    row_number() over(partition by Id order by Month desc) as rk 
from Employee) a where rk != 1

R code:
Employee <- data.frame(Id = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3),
                       Month = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4),
                       Salary = c(20, 20, 30, 30, 40, 40, 60, 60, 70)
)
Employee %>% group_by(Id) %>%
  arrange(desc(Month)) %>%
  filter(row_number() != 1) %>%
  arrange(Id, Month) %>%
  mutate(l1 = lag(Salary, 1),
         l2 = lag(Salary, 2)) %>%
  replace_na(list(l1 = 0, l2 = 0)) %>%
  mutate(total_salary = l1 + l2 + Salary) %>%
  select(Id, Month, Salary = total_salary) %>%
  arrange(Id, desc(Month))


The Employee table holds the salary information in a year.

Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee's salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month.
