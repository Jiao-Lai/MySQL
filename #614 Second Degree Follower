SELECT DISTINCT
    followee AS follower,
    COUNT(DISTINCT follower) AS num
FROM follow
WHERE followee in (SELECT DISTINCT follower FROM follow)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

R code: 
follow <- data.frame(
     followee = c("A", "B", "B", "D"),
     follower = c("B", "C", "D", "E"))
library(dplyr)
follow %>%
  inner_join(follow, by = c('follower' = 'followee')) %>%
  group_by(follower) %>%
  summarize(num = n_distinct(follower.y))

In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower’s follower if he/she has one.
