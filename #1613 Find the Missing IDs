step 1: find max id
step 2: create a table containing all id from 1 to max id
step 3: query id which is missing from table customers 

WITH RECURSIVE ids AS(
    SELECT 1 AS id UNION SELECT id + 1 AS id FROM ids WHERE id < (SELECT max(customer_id) FROM customers)
)

SELECT
    id AS ids 
FROM ids 
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers)
ORDER BY 1

Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
 

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.
