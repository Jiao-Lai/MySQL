step 1: query student from each continent, create a reference column recording their order by name within continent
step 2: join above tables using reference column

SELECT
    America,
    Asia,
    Europe
FROM
(SELECT
    name AS 'America',
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS ref
FROM student
WHERE continent = 'America') a LEFT JOIN
(SELECT
    name AS 'Asia',
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS ref
FROM student
WHERE continent = 'Asia') b ON a.ref = b.ref 
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT
    name AS 'Europe',
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS ref
FROM student
WHERE continent = 'Europe') c ON a.ref = c.ref


A U.S graduate school has students from Asia, Europe and America. The students' location information are stored in table student as below.
 

| name   | continent |
|--------|-----------|
| Jack   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jane   | America   |
 

Pivot the continent column in this table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia and Europe respectively. It is guaranteed that the student number from America is no less than either Asia or Europe.
