step 1: count the number of employees in each company, and creat a new column of their rank within company
step 2: select record with median salary given the definition of median

Solution:
select
    Id,
    Company, 
    Salary
from
(select
    Id,
    Company, 
    Salary,
    count(*) over(partition by Company) as cnt,
    row_number() over(partition by Company order by Salary) as rk
from Employee) a 
where rk between cnt/2 and cnt/2 + 1 

R code:
median<- salary %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>%
  summarize(median_salary = median(Salary)) %>%
  ungroup()

median %>% inner_join(salary, by = c('Company' = 'Company', 'median_salary' = 'Salary')) %>%
  select(Id, Company, Salary = median_salary)

Question:
The Employee table holds all employees. The employee table has three columns: Employee Id, Company Name, and Salary.
Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.
