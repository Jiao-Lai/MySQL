step 1: use window function to calculate total weight at each turn
step 2: sort cumulative weight in descending order
step 3: select the first person where cumulative weight is <= 1000

SELECT
    person_name 
FROM
(SELECT
    person_name,
    sum(weight) over(order by turn) as cum_weight
FROM Queue) a
WHERE cum_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY cum_weight DESC
LIMIT 1

Table: Queue

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id is the primary key column for this table.
This table has the information about all people waiting for an elevator.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
 

The maximum weight the elevator can hold is 1000.

Write an SQL query to find the person_name of the last person who will fit in the elevator without exceeding the weight limit. It is guaranteed that the person who is first in the queue can fit in the elevator.
