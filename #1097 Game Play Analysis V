step 1: create table install recording the install date of each player_id
step 2: install_dt left join activity to get playe who also logged in the next day
step 3: count to get installs and retention rate

with install as (
select
    player_id,
    min(event_date) as install_dt
from activity
group by 1)

select
    install_dt,
    count(*) as installs,
    round(count(distinct a.player_id)/count(*),2) as Day1_retention
from install i left join activity a on a.player_id = i.player_id and datediff(a.event_date, i.install_dt) = 1 group by 1

R code:
Activity <- data.frame(player_id = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3),
                       device_id = c(2, 2, 3, 1, 4),
                       event_date = c('2016-03-01', '2016-03-02', '2017-06-25', '2016-03-01', '2016-07-03'),
                       games_played = c(5, 6, 1, 0, 5)
)

install <- Activity %>%
           mutate(event_date = as.Date(event_date)) %>%
           group_by(player_id) %>%
           summarize(install_dt = min(event_date))
           
retention <- install %>% left_join(Activity, by = 'player_id')  %>%
         mutate(daydiff = floor(difftime(event_date, install_dt, units = 'days'))) %>%
         filter(daydiff == 1) %>%
         select(player_id, install_dt)

install %>%
  group_by(install_dt) %>%
  summarize(installs = n()) %>%
  left_join(retention, by = 'install_dt') %>%
  group_by(install_dt) %>%
  mutate(Day1_retention = round(sum(!is.na(player_id))/installs,2)) %>%
  select(-player_id)
  
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

We define the install date of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define day 1 retention of some date X to be the number of players whose install date is X and they logged back in on the day right after X, divided by the number of players whose install date is X, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Write an SQL query that reports for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day and the day 1 retention.
