step 1: calculate average occurences for each event_type
step 2: compare occurences for each event_type with average occurences of that event_type, if bigger, flag the record as 1 otherwise 0
step 3: query business_id which was flagged more than once

SELECT
    business_id
FROM
(SELECT
    business_id,
    IF(occurences > mean, 1, 0) AS flag
FROM
(SELECT
    *,
    AVG(occurences) over(PARTITION BY event_type) AS mean
FROM Events) a) b 
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(flag) > 1

Table: Events

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurences    | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occured at some business for a number of times.
 

Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.
